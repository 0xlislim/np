## Tips for Success

- Use the same profile photo across platforms for consistency
- Keep project documentation clean and understandable
- Be active: join LinkedIn discussions, publish articles, or comment thoughtfully
- After meeting someone at an event (if applicable), connect with them on LinkedIn within 24 hours
- Pin your best GitHub projects and keep your codebase clean and well-commented
- Fork repositories that interest you - this shows engagement with the community and helps you learn from others' code
- Start with simple community participation - introduce yourself and ask questions rather than trying to contribute code immediately
- Follow developers whose work inspires you - this helps you stay updated with industry trends
- Be genuine in community interactions - focus on learning and sharing rather than self-promotion
- Bookmark and star repositories you want to reference or learn from later
