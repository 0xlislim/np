## 1. LinkedIn Profile Best Practices for DevOps

### Headline Examples (use keywords for visibility)
- `Fullstack Developer | Aspiring DevOps Engineer | CI/CD | Cloud Infrastructure | Automation`
- `Software Engineer | DevOps Enthusiast | Kubernetes | Terraform | Systems Programming`
- `Fullstack Dev transitioning to DevOps | Docker | Linux | Infrastructure as Code`
- `Developer & DevOps | Building Scalable Systems | Go | Rust | Cloud Native`

### About/Summary Best Practices
Your summary should highlight:
- **Measurable achievements** (e.g., "Implemented CI/CD pipeline reducing deployment time by 50%")
- **Technical skills** relevant to DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, scripting)
- **Career goals** - transitioning from fullstack to DevOps/systems programming
- **What you're learning** - shows growth mindset

**Example Summary:**
```
Fullstack developer with X years of experience building web applications,
now transitioning into DevOps and systems programming. Passionate about
infrastructure automation, containerization, and building reliable systems.

Currently exploring: Kubernetes, Terraform, Go/Rust for systems tools, Linux internals.

I believe in automation-first approaches and infrastructure as code.
Looking to contribute to open source DevOps tools and connect with
like-minded engineers building the future of cloud infrastructure.
