## 5. LINKEDIN POSTS (5 Required)

### POST 1: Microservices Journey with 01Blog
**Best time to post:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM

```
Just wrapped up a 3-month deep dive into microservices architecture!

Built a full-stack blogging platform (01Blog) that taught me:

-> How to properly separate concerns across frontend, backend, and database services
-> JWT authentication implementation in Spring Boot
-> Role-based access control at scale (100+ concurrent users)
-> The importance of 85% test coverage before deployment

Tech stack: Angular | Spring Boot | PostgreSQL | Docker Compose

The biggest lesson? Microservices aren't about making things complex—they're about making complexity manageable.

What's your experience with microservices? Worth the overhead for small teams?

### POST 2: Real-Time Systems with Go
**Best time to post:** Wednesday, 9 AM

```
Building real-time applications changed how I think about backend development.

My recent project: A forum with live WebSocket chat handling 500+ requests/second.

Key learnings:

1. Go's goroutines make concurrency feel natural
2. WebSockets > polling for real-time features
3. Proper connection pooling reduced server load by 40%

The hardest part wasn't the code—it was understanding when to optimize and when to ship.

What real-time challenges have you solved recently?

#Golang #WebSockets #BackendDevelopment #SystemDesign #Programming
```

### POST 3: Systems Programming in Rust
**Best time to post:** Thursday, 8 AM

```
I built a Unix shell from scratch in Rust. Here's what 6 weeks of systems programming taught me:

Writing 0-Shell meant:

-> Direct Linux kernel communication via system calls
-> Implementing process management (fork, exec, wait)
-> Signal handling that actually works
-> I/O redirection without any libraries

Rust's ownership model caught bugs at compile time that would have been memory leaks in C.

Systems programming isn't just about performance—it's about understanding what your code actually does at the hardware level.

Any other developers exploring Rust for systems work?

### POST 4: From Developer to Release Manager
**Best time to post:** Tuesday, 10 AM

```
Plot twist: Becoming a release manager made me a better developer.

At Zone01, I coordinate deployments and manage Git workflows for our team. Here's what changed:

Before: "It works on my machine"
After: "It works in every environment"

Key practices I've adopted:

-> GitFlow for organized branching
-> Docker for environment consistency
-> Pre-merge code reviews (no exceptions)
-> Automated testing in CI pipelines

The best code is code that deploys reliably.

What deployment practices have transformed your team's workflow?

### POST 5: CTF Win + Security Mindset
**Best time to post:** Friday, 9 AM

```
First place in our campus CTF competition!

Competing against 40+ participants taught me that security isn't a feature—it's a mindset.

What I practiced:

-> Reverse engineering binaries
-> Web exploitation techniques
-> Cryptography challenges
-> Thinking like an attacker to build better defenses

As developers, we write the code attackers try to break. Understanding both sides makes us better engineers.

Next goal: Integrate security testing into my CI/CD pipelines.

Any recommended resources for developers wanting to learn security?
