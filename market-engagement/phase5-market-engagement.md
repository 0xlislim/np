## Progress Tracker

## Tips for Success

1. **Quality over quantity** - One thoughtful comment > 10 generic "Great post!" comments
2. **Be genuine** - Share what you're actually learning, not performative content
3. **Follow up** - If a recruiter accepts your connection, send a thank-you message
4. **Track responses** - Note which recruiters engage back for future reference
5. **Stay consistent** - 15-20 minutes daily is better than 2 hours once a week
